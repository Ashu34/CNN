#Convolutional Neural Network Implementation in Python
Implementaion of Convolution operation in Python using the numpy library fo efficient Matrix operations.
I have implemented the convolution of an 3D signal with a 3D filter using the im2col algorithm.
Im2col basically tranforms the convolution operation into matrix multiplication which can be efficiently done by broadcasting in numpy.
Maxpooling and Col2im is also implemented.
